# Lunch Hour Management System

This project is based on managing Lunch Hour system of any company.

### Installation:

`git clone` this repository and `cd` inside the project root, then enter the following commands

1. `composer install --prefer-dist --div -vvv` (might take a while to complete)

2. `cp .env.example .env`

3. `php artisan key:generate`

    Now open `.env` file and make necessary changes to the **DB_** section.
    
    **Yes, of course, you'll have to setup a database and it's user already before the next step!**
    Otherwise, exactly what settings were you going to put in the _DB\__ section of the `.env` file? :P

4. `php artisan migrate`

5. ``php artisan serve`

    Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

6.  php artisan route:clear`

    You may use the route:clear command to clear the route cache

7. `php artisan route:cache`

    Using the route cache will drastically decrease the amount of time it takes to register all of your application's routes.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
